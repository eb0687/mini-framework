# Mini framework

A mini framework project that handles DOM abstraction, routing, state management, and event handling

## Prerequisites

- [bun](https://bun.sh/docs/installation)

## Getting started

- After cloning the project, run the below commands in the root directory of the project:

```shell
bun i
bun run dev
```

- Open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser to explore the TodoMVC app built with the framework.
- This TodoMVC app serves as a demonstration exercise to verify that the framework’s core features—such as routing,
  state management, and event handling—are working as intended. It mirrors the functionality of the [JavaScript ES5 TodoMVC example](https://todomvc.com/examples/javascript-es5/dist/#/).

- For more details on how to use the framework, check out the [documentation](https://eb0687.github.io/mini-framework/).
