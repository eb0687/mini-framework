## Optional prerequisites

[bun](https://bun.sh/docs/installation) ---> [why?](https://medium.com/@pavan1419/bun-vs-npm-yarn-pnpm-what-every-developer-should-know-fbe66991e7eb)

## Getting started

- After cloning the project, run the below commands in the root directory of the project:

```shell
bun i
bun run dev
```

**OR**

If you prefer npm follow the below steps:

- Delete the `bun.lockb` file in the root of the project and run the below
  commands.

```shell
npm install
npm run dev
```

- Open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser to explore the TodoMVC app built with the framework.
- This TodoMVC app serves as a demonstration exercise to verify that the framework’s core features—such as routing,
  state management, and event handling—are working as intended. It mirrors the functionality of the [JavaScript ES5 TodoMVC example](https://todomvc.com/examples/javascript-es5/dist/#/).

- For more details on how to use the framework, check out the [documentation](https://eb0687.github.io/mini-framework/).
- The documentation is hosted on github-pages created with [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) and
  markdown.
