# Routing

This module provides a minimal client-side router for use in single-page applications (SPAs).
It allows defining route handlers, navigating programmatically, and creating link elements
that update both the URL and the appâ€™s state based on user actions, enabling smooth navigation
without reloading the page.

---

## router()

Initializes the router by checking the current path (window.location.pathname) and rendering the associated page into the app element.

```js
import { router } from "../framework/router";

router();
```

:::warning
This must be called at the end of your `index.js` to function correctly.
:::

---

## link(href, ...children)

### **Parameters**

- **`href`** (`string`)  
  The route defined in the window.route
  Example: "/home", "/404"

- **`...children`** (`string | Node`)
  Any number of child elements to append to the created element.
  - Strings are converted to text nodes.
  - Nodes are appended directly.

A custom link element that, when clicked, calls navigate(path) instead of triggering a full page reload.

:::note
Why not use a regular a tag?

The browser would reload the page and make a new request to the server.
In an SPA, you want to stay on the same page and just swap the content dynamically.
Behind the scenes link calls on a custom function navigate() which
handles this for us.
:::

```js
import { link } from "../framework/router";

const aboutPage = link("/about", "About");
```

---

## Example usage

```js
// index.js
import { div, h1, li, ul } from "../../framework";
import { link, router } from "../../framework/router";
import "./styles.css";

const homePage = div(
  { class: "page" },
  h1({}, "Welcome to the home page"),
  ul(
    {},
    li({ class: "list-item" }, link("/about", "About Page")),
    li({ class: "list-item" }, link("/other", "Another Page")),
  ),
);

const aboutPage = div(
  { class: "page" },
  h1({}, "Welcome to the about page"),
  ul({}, li({ class: "list-item" }, link("/", "Home"))),
);

const otherPage = div(
  { class: "page" },
  h1({}, "Welcome to yet another page"),
  ul({}, li({ class: "list-item" }, link("/", "Home"))),
);

const pageNotFound = div(
  { class: "page" },
  h1({}, "Page Not Found"),
  ul({}, li({ class: "list-item" }, link("/", "Home"))),
);

window.routes = {
  "/": homePage,
  "/about": aboutPage,
  "/other": otherPage,
  "/404": pageNotFound,
};

router();
```

:::warning

- Ensure that the window.routes is defined or the app will not work
- Ensure that a 404 route exists or else the app will not work
